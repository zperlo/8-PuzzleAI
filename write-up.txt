1. Code design:
    As is likely obvious, I chose to write in python. I made the decision to store the state
    as a tuple. Originally I was storing it as a list, but I wanted to use states as the 
    keys for a few dictionaries. Since dictionaries need their keys to be immutable, I 
    switched over to using a tuple. For example, the goal state is represented as
    goal = ('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8')

    That was the main design choice made. For the rest I'll go in order.

    First I used sys to recognize the input and then copy each line of the input file to 
    a list, where each line (and thus each command) is a separate element of the list, so 
    it's very easy to iterate over to make sure each commant is performed.

    


maxNodes 18
randomizeState 30
printState
solve A-star h1
printState
solve A-star h2

h1 fails but h2 doesn't (h2 fails at maxNodes = 9, much better)
